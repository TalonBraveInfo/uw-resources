The contents of these have been altered slightly to better represent their original implementation.

Just after September in 2003, it seems Epic Games started repurposing some of this code for Onslaught, the mode that ended up being featured in Unreal Tournament 2004. Very little of this code actually survived into Unreal Tournament 2004.

The timing of this has made me suspect that it was around this same time that Epic Games decided to reboot Unreal Warfare - it was only in November that their first Bonus Pack for Unreal Tournament 2003 was released which repurposed several maps from Unreal Warfare - but that's speculation on my part.

The only modification was to change the header include back to `VehiclesPrivate.h`

This is also, unfortunately, incomplete at this time.

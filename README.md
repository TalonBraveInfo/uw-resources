# Unreal Warfare Resources

This project aims to piece together all resources that were trickled out over the years
that were originally intended for Epic Games' Unreal Warfare, which was the predecessor
to what eventually became Gears of War.

Many of these resources have been accidently left in some third-party games, as content 
from Unreal Warfare was included as examples of what licensees could potentially do
with the engine.

## Regarding Resources in UT2k4

Keep in mind that while nearly all the static models and textures are included with Unreal
Tournament 2004, many of these packages may have been altered or modified in various
ways - they will eventually make their way up but it all needs to be reviewed very
carefully.
